A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.
The motivation for this project is to complete a coding assessment to prepare for an interview process. 
This project was built as an interactive coding challenge. 
The problem solved is to take a timed quiz on coding fundamentals.

I worked through challenges with syntax errors & unresponsivness. 
Front End Technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery.
